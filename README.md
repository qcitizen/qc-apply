## Exercise

Write a function that compresses an alphanumeric string by collapsing consecutive values. The rules of the compression algorithm are defined by the test cases below.


## Test cases

Each item below has an input value and the expected output from the function.

1. `aaabccccdd` → `a3bc4d2`
2. `aaaaaffffffffffc` → `a5f10c`
3. `abcd` → `abcd` (note: not `a1b1c1d1`)
4. `ccceee12eccceee` → `c3e4c3e3` (numbers removed)
5. `effeac01cb65c` → `ef2eac2bc`


## Timeboxing

Try to complete this task within 30 minutes.


## What we'll be looking at

- Code structure — specifically how readable and understandable it is
    - (Optional) Consider using of whitespace and inline doc strings for clarity
- Git usage — granularity of commits and any branches or tags
- Edge cases — how they're handled so they won't be forgotten
    - (Optional) Describe or implement a solution for each case (if any)
- Bonus: Add a very basic test for each case


## What we won't be looking at

- Language — use whatever programming language you're most comfortable with
- Number of lines — it can be any length as long as it's readable and understandable
- Time spent — just be honest and tell us how you used the time
